In this assignment, I was tasked to implement an insertion sort algorithm
of complexity O(n^2). Unlike traditional insertion sort, instead of swapping values
immediately, the algorithm will 'slide' to all unchecked values before performing
the insertion. A pdf containing empirical analysis of the algorithm is included
for further insight into its average operational cost and complexity in the 
average, best, and worst case.
