In this assignment, I was tasked to implement an insertion sort algorithm
of complexity O(n^2). Unlike traditional insertion sort, instead of swapping values
immediately, the algorithm will 'slide' to all unchecked values before performing
the insertion. The user also has the option to run the algorithm in debug mode, 
making it possible to visualize the algorithm in the console. 
A pdf containing empirical analysis of the algorithm is included for further insight 
into the algorithm's average operational cost and complexity in the 
average, best, and worst case.
